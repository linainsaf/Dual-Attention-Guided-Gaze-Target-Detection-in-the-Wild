# Dual-Attention-Guided-Gaze-Target-Detection-in-the-Wild
projet MLA M2
- depth estimation: based on a previous research Towards Robust Monocular Depth Estimation: Mixing Datasets for Zero-shot Cross-dataset Transfer
- depth rebasing: 
  - from an input image, we extract the head image.
  - from 3D gaze detection, we get the depth channel gaze value gz.
  - we write a python code based on the studied article section 3.2.
